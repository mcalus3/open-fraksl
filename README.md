## About

**open-fraksl** is a tool for you to create beautiful, yet simple generative art. Its aim is to allow user to explore unlimited possibilities of shaping his own fractals.

## Inspiration, libriaries and dependencies

I decided to make this app after many hours of playing with a mobile app, called [Fraksl](https://fraksl.com/). I was wondering - would I be able to write down a procedure that would generate such a fractal?  
**open-fraksl** wouldn't be possible without these great open-source projects:

react  
typescript  
material-ui  
Create-React-App  
create-react-app-typescript  
create-react-app-material-typescript-redux  
pixi.js  
gsap  
react-use-dimensions

Thanks!

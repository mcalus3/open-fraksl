## About

**open-fraksl** is a simple tool for you to create beautiful generative art. Its aim is to allow user to explore unlimited possibilities of shaping his own fractals.

## Inspiration

I decided to make this app after many hours of playing with a mobile app, called [Fraksl](https://fraksl.com/). I was wondering - would I be able to write down a procedure that would generate such a fractal?
